# Key Terms Glossary

## 📚 Overview
This glossary summarizes important cybersecurity definitions and foundational concepts introduced in **Module 1 – Foundations of Cybersecurity** from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.  
These terms are essential for understanding how analysts think about risk, defense, and information protection.

---

| **Term** | **Definition / Explanation** | **Example / Relevance** |
|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Cybersecurity** | The practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation while maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability (the *CIA Triad*). | Securing company databases, firewalls, and cloud accounts. |
| **CIA Triad** | The three core principles of information security: **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**. | Confidentiality = Encryption; Integrity = Checksums; Availability = Backups. |
| **Threat Actor** | Any person or group that poses a potential security risk, intentionally or accidentally. | Hacktivist group launching DDoS attacks; insider leaking data. |
| **Internal Threat** | Security risk originating from inside an organization — employees, vendors, or trusted partners. | A user clicking on a phishing email or intentionally stealing data. |
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness or flaw in a system that could be exploited by a threat actor. | Unpatched operating systems or outdated software. |
| **Risk** | The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. | Failing to update firewalls may lead to a data breach. |
| **Security Posture** | The overall strength of an organization’s security controls and ability to detect/respond to threats. | Mature SOC operations = strong posture. |
| **Security Control** | Safeguard or countermeasure used to reduce security risk. | Antivirus software, MFA, access control lists. |
| **Compliance** | Adherence to laws, standards, and policies to avoid fines and breaches. | Following HIPAA, GDPR, or PCI DSS regulations. |
| **Security Framework** | A structured guideline for managing security risks and best practices. | NIST CSF, ISO 27001, COBIT. |
| **Network Security** | Protecting an organization’s network infrastructure and traffic from unauthorized access. | Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs. |
| **Cloud Security** | Safeguarding assets stored in cloud environments through access controls and correct configuration. | Limiting AWS S3 permissions. |
| **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** | Any information that can identify an individual. | Name, address, phone number. |
| **SPII (Sensitive PII)** | Highly confidential data requiring strict protection. | Social Security numbers, medical records. |
| **Incident Response** | The process of identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents. | Handling a ransomware attack. |
| **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** | Tool that collects and analyzes log data to identify potential threats. | Splunk, Chronicle, or QRadar. |
| **IDS/IPS** | Systems that detect or prevent intrusions in a network. | Snort, Suricata, Security Onion. |
| **Programming for Security** | Writing scripts to automate detection and analysis tasks. | Python for log parsing and alert correlation. |
